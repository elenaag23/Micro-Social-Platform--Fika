This is a micro-social platform using the ASP.NET Core 6 and MVC Entity Framework. This was a team project so I worked with one of my colleagues. On our micro-social media platform you can add posts to feed, add comments to posts, join groups and add posts there as well, edit your profile, send and accept friend requests, etc.
