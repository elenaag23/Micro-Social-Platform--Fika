This is a micro-social platform using the ASP.NET Core 6, MVC architecture, Identity Framework, Entity Framework, Razor, Bootstrap. This was a team project so I worked with one of my colleagues. We needed to implement CRUD operations on posts, comments, groups and profile. On our micro-social media platform you can add posts to feed, add comments to posts, join groups and add posts there as well, edit your profile, send and accept friend requests, etc.
